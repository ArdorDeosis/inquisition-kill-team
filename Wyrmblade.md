# The Stealthy Inquisitor

*Wyrmblade*

This team emphasizes stealth and ambushes with their abilities and ploys (*Cult Ambush*, *Creeping Shadow*, *One With the Shadows*, *Slink Into Darkness*, *Hiding*, ...).

1 Inquisitor and 13 Henchmen (some count as two, some more restrictions apply, see the Wyrmblade kill team for details)

## The Inquisitor

*Neophyte Leader*

(S)he has a nice selection of weapons to chose from (and the same stat block as a Scion).
The *Shadow Vector* ability emphasizes how (s)he's pulling the strings in the background.


## Guardsman or Other Inquisitorial Henchman
Your rank and file. Their stat blocks match a guardsman's exactly. But they could also be used as some different sort of standard human(-like) henchman, e.g. gangers from the underhive or maybe even a combat automaton.

### Warrior

*Neophyte Brood-Adept*

The standard weapons' stats also match a guardsman's (autogun = lasgun; gun butt = bayonet). But this inquisitor gifts a shotgun to some of the guardsmen, so that's a reason to work for him!

### Gunner

*Neophyte Gunner*

The gunner has slightly less options than a normal guardsman gunner, but...

### Heavy Gunner

*Neophyte Heavy Gunner*

...a normal guard kill team does not have a heavy gunner at all! And if you're not comfortable with equipping your guys with a mining laser, just call it a special issue Stalker Pattern Boltgun (same special rules, but more attacks and more damage) or some kind of plasma weapon.

### Veteran / Squad Leader

*Neuophyte Icon Bearer*

Since it is not really suiting for a stealthy team to have an ancient, the *Neophyte Icon Bearer* could be made into an inspiring veteran of some sort or the leader of a squad of guardsmen the inquisitor employs. The *Signal to Strike* action certainly would fit.


## Assassins
### Vindicare Assassin (or other Sniper)
*Sanctus Sniper* [counts as two]

Well it says 'sniper' right there in the name of the *Sanctus Sniper*, and it has some nice special abilities (*Preternatural Assassin*) and actions (*Target Vulnerability*, *Familiar's Soulsight*) to underline that.

### Callidus Assassin (or other stealthy assassin)
*Sanctus Talon* [counts as two]

The *Sanctus Talon* has special abilities and actions to emphasize stealth (*Creeping Shadow*, *Cult Ambush*).


## Space Marines in Scout Armor

The stat blocks of the *Sanctus Sniper*, *Sanctus Talon*, *Keleromorph* and *Locus* all can be used as a scout marine. `M`, `ALP`, `GA` and `DF` match most space marines (first-born and primaris), while `SV` and `W` are nearly the same values as a space marine scout has.

### With Power Weapon
*Locus* [counts as two]

The locus blades roughly match a power sword and the barbed tail could be a silenced bolt pistol.

### With Sniper Rifle
*Sanctus Sniper* [counts as two]

The sniper rifle stats of the space marine scout and the *Sanctus Sniper* match perfectly and with the Vindicare Assassin, the 'Target Vulnerability' and 'Familiar's Soulsight' abilities make this operative really feel like a sniper.

### With Bolt Rifle
*Keleromorph* [counts as two]

Granted, the bolt rifle has a slightly different stat block compared to the liberator autostubs, but the *Hypersense* action and *Expert Gunslinger* ability really drive home the feeling that you have a very well trained marine here who knows how to handle his gun compared to the mortals running around in this team.



Example

Your Inquisitor employs a troop of 7 guardsmen. They are the rest of a squad that the inquisitor witnessed accomplishing exceptional deeds in a warzone some time ago, after which he enlisted them for his team. Among them is their leader and two weapon specialists.
To fill in what the guard squad misses in heavy weapons, the insquisitor has two gangers from a hive city with him. They used to craft makeshift heavy weapons for the gangs under the city with experimental technology.
Depending on the mission the inquisitor also has access to a Vindicare or a Callidus assassin.
Further, the team is accompanied by a veteran space marine in light armor carrying a bolt rifle. He's inspiring the hell out of the guardsmen, who are honoured to fight alongside an astartes.

* 1x Inquisitor (*Neophyte Leader*)
* 1x Callidus Assassin (*Sanctus Talon*) or Vindicare Assassin (*Sanctus Sniper*)
* 1x Space Marine (*Keleromorph*)
* 1x Guardsmen Leader (*Neophyte Icon Baerer*)
* 4x Guardsmen (*Neophyte Brood-Adept*)
* 2x Guardsmen Gunner (*Neophyte Gunner*)
* 2x Experimental Heavy Weapons Specialists (*Neophyte Heavy Gunner*)
