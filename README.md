# Inquisition Kill Team

Here you can find several options for creating an Inquisition kill team (for 2nd edition). The kill teams are re-flavours of officially released kill teams, no rules have changed, so they are as balanced as it gets.

## The Kill Teams

* [The Inquisitor in the Shadows](killteams/wyrmblade.md) (Wyrmblade)
* [The Team Featuring Space Marines](killteams/traitor-space-marines.md) (Traitor Space Marine)
* *Name Pending* (Voidscarred)
* *Name Pending* (Warpcoven)


# How Do I Use These?

Rules-wise, you simply use the rules of the kill teams and operatives these Inquisition kill teams are based on (e.g. the *Wyrmblade* rules for the [sneaky Inquisition team](killteams/wyrmblade.md)).


# Flavouring Existing Kill Teams

Flavouring (or re-flavouring) is the act of taking some rules and stripping them of everything except the hard facts and numbers and then adding flavour in yourself. As an example: Your operative having a 4+ invulnerable save is the hard fact, *why* it has this, is the flavour. This can be a holo-suit (void-dancer troupe), a shield generator (hunter cadre) or a boon from Tzeentch (warpcoven). Or it can be something you make up on your own.

In kill team the rules provide almost no flavour at all except the names of operatives, abilities, weapons, etc. This makes re-flavouring fairly easy.

The kill teams in this repository are fun little thought experiments I like to spend my free time on and they are by far not meant to be comprehensive. If you have ideas you want to see on the battlefield yourself, do some re-flavouring of your own and feel free to use these ideas as starting point or inspiration.
