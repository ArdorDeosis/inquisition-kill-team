# Inquisition Kill Team

I now and then hear voices calling for an Inquisition kill team. Fairly regularly, to be honest. While creating your own rules for that might be a fun project, it is hard to get these rules balanced. A solution to this problem is what the D&D community knows as *flavouring*, less commonly used in Warhammer under the term of *proxy* or *counts-as* (see [Flavouring](#Flavouring Existing Kill Teams) below for more detail).

# Flavouring Existing Kill Teams

Flavouring (or re-flavouring) is the act of taking some rules and stripping them of everything except the hard facts and numbers and then adding flavour in yourself. As an example: Your operative having a 4+ invulnerable save is the hard fact, *why* it has this, is the flavour. This can be a holo-suit (void-dancer troupe), a shield generator (hunter cadre) or a boon from Tzeentch (warpcoven). Or it can be something you make up on your own.

In kill team the rules provide almost no flavour at all except the names of operatives, abilities, weapons, etc. This makes re-flavouring fairly easy.

These documents are fun little thought experiments I like to spend my free time on and they are by far not meant to be comprehensive. If you have ideas you want to see on the battlefield yourself, do some re-flavouring of your own and feel free to use these ideas as starting point or inspiration.
