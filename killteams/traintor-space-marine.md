# The Kill Team With Marines
*based on the Traitor Space Marine team*

Using the *Traitor Space Marine* rules from the compedium, this inquisition team has nothing special about it despite the fact that it employ space marines. Since there are not much options, it doesn't make sense to go into too much detail.

You're fielding one *Chaos Space Marine* fire team and one *Chaos Cultist* fire team with a leader. The *Chaos Cultist Champion* is your inquisitor and the *Chaos Cultist Fighters* and *Chaos Cultist Gunners* are the human entourage.

The *Chaos Space Marines* have a little more options, you'll likely take a regular one, an *Icon Bearer* and one of either a *Gunner* or *Heavy Gunner*. You could flavour them as Deathwatch, though they lack the variety in weaponry a Deathwatch kill team offers. You could also flavour them as any other chapter you want (even multiple).


# Example
* 1 Inquisitor (*Chaos Cultist Champion*)
* 3 Deathwatch Marines (*Chaos Space Marine*, *Chaos Space Marine Icon Bearer*, *Chaos Space Marine Gunner* / *Chaos Space Marine Heavy Gunner*)
* 7 Human Entourage (5 *Chaos Cultists*, 2 *Chaos Cultist Gunners*)
