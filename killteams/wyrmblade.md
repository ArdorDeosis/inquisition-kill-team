# The Inquisitor in the Shadows
*based on the Wyrmblade*

The *Wyrmblade* is a team focussed on stealth and ambush tactics and has many abilities, actions and ploys to emphasize this (*Cult Ambush*, *Creeping Shadow*, *One With the Shadows*, *Slink Into Darkness*, *Hiding*, ...).

Most likely your team will be made up of one inquisitor, nine regular humans (incl. one icon bearer, two gunners and two heavy gunners) and two hero units (count as two operatives).

## The Inquisitor
*Neophyte Leader*

The inquisitor themselves has the same stat block as a Scion, a selection of five ranged and four melee weapons to chose from and the *Shadow Vector* ability to emphasize how (s)he's pulling the strings in the background. And if an inquisitor with a power pick seems a little too quirky, just flavour it as a special power weapon or, if you are inclined, some xenos artifact.


## Guardsman or Other Inquisitorial Henchman
Your rank and file. Their stat blocks match a guardsman's exactly. As such they are suited to be used as any kind of human retinue to the inquisitor. Guardsmen, other inquisitorial henchmen, even gangers from the underhive. The *Gunner*, *Heavy Gunner* and *Icon Bearer* versions bring in some variation, not only in weaponry.

### Warrior
*Neophyte Brood-Adept*

The standard weapons' stats also match a guardsman's (autogun = lasgun; gun butt = bayonet). But this inquisitor gifts a shotgun to some of the guardsmen, so that's a reason to work for him!

### Gunner
*Neophyte Gunner*

The gunner has slightly less options than a normal guardsman gunner, but still a solid arsenal.

### Heavy Gunner
*Neophyte Heavy Gunner*

If you don't want to equip your guardsmen with a mining laser, just call it a special issue Stalker Pattern Boltgun (same special rules, but more attacks and more damage) or some kind of plasma weapon.

### Veteran / Squad Leader
*Neuophyte Icon Bearer*

Since it is not really suiting for a stealthy team to have an ancient, the *Neophyte Icon Bearer* could be used as an inspiring veteran of some sort or the leader of a squad of guardsmen the inquisitor employs. The *Signal to Strike* action certainly would fit.


## Assassins
### Vindicare Assassin (or other Sniper)
*Sanctus Sniper* [counts as two]

Not much to elaborate here, it says 'sniper' right there in the name. And it has some nice special abilities (*Preternatural Assassin*) and actions (*Target Vulnerability*, *Familiar's Soulsight*) to underline that.

### Callidus Assassin (or other stealthy assassin)
*Sanctus Talon* [counts as two]

The *Sanctus Talon* has special abilities and actions to emphasize stealth (*Creeping Shadow*, *Cult Ambush*).


## Space Marines in Scout Armor

The stat blocks of the *Sanctus Sniper*, *Sanctus Talon*, *Keleromorph* and *Locus* all can be used as a scout marine. `M`, `ALP`, `GA` and `DF` match most space marines (first-born and primaris), while `SV` and `W` are nearly the same values as a space marine scout has.

### With Power Weapon
*Locus* [counts as two]

The locus blades roughly match a power sword and the barbed tail could be a silenced bolt pistol.

### With Sniper Rifle
*Sanctus Sniper* [counts as two]

The sniper rifle stats of the space marine scout and the *Sanctus Sniper* match perfectly and with the Vindicare Assassin, the 'Target Vulnerability' and 'Familiar's Soulsight' abilities make this operative really feel like a sniper.

### With Bolt Rifle
*Keleromorph* [counts as two]

Granted, the bolt rifle has a slightly different stat block compared to the liberator autostubs, but the *Hypersense* action and *Expert Gunslinger* ability really drive home the feeling that you have a very well trained marine here who knows how to handle his gun compared to the mortals running around in this team.


# Example

Your Inquisitor employs a troop of 7 guardsmen. They are the rest of a squad that the inquisitor witnessed accomplishing exceptional deeds in a warzone some time ago, after which he enlisted them for his team. Among them is their leader and two weapon specialists.
To fill in what the guard squad misses in heavy weapons, the insquisitor has two gangers from a hive city with him. They used to craft makeshift heavy weapons for the gangs under the city with experimental technology.
Depending on the mission the inquisitor also has access to a Vindicare or a Callidus assassin.
Further, the team is accompanied by a veteran space marine in light armor carrying a bolt rifle. He's inspiring the hell out of the guardsmen, who are honoured to fight alongside an astartes.

* 1x Inquisitor (*Neophyte Leader*)
* 1x Callidus Assassin (*Sanctus Talon*) or Vindicare Assassin (*Sanctus Sniper*)
* 1x Space Marine (*Keleromorph*)
* 1x Guardsmen Leader (*Neophyte Icon Baerer*)
* 4x Guardsmen (*Neophyte Brood-Adept*)
